# Getting started

![](/assets/logo/header.svg)

vectorbt PRO is the next-generation engine for backtesting, algorithmic trading, and research. 
It's a high-performance, actively-developed, commercial successor to the [vectorbt](https://github.com/polakowo/vectorbt) 
library, one of the world's most innovative open-source backtesting engines. The PRO version extends the 
standard library with new impressive features and useful enhancements for professionals.

We bring many [SOTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art){target=_blank} tools and libraries
under one umbrella and automate them. Our vision is to make quantitative analysis and 
algorithmic trading accessible to everyone. Join us!

!!! note
    vectorbt PRO is a commercial successor to the community version of vectorbt. The entire functionality
    of this package is proprietary and __won't__ be open-sourced.

## What is vectorbt PRO?

vectorbt PRO is a private fork of vectorbt, hosted as a private GitHub repository. 
All new features are developed as part of this fork, which means that they are immediately 
and exclusively available to all eligible sponsors, as they are made collaborators of this repository.

Sponsorships for the first 100 contributors start as low as [__$25 a month or $500 one time__](#how-to-become-a-sponsor).[^1]
One-time payments can also be made in :material-bitcoin: and :material-ethereum: - please [contact me](emailto:olegpolakow@gmail.com).

!!! info
    With each new milestone, the price will steadily increase to match that of competitors. By subscribing now, 
    you will become an early contributor and secure this price to access all features that will follow!

[^1]:
    This rate applies to individuals only. To grant access for an organization, please 
    [contact me](emailto:olegpolakow@gmail.com).

## What sponsorships achieve

Sponsorships make this project sustainable, as they buy the maintainers of this
project time – a very scarce resource – which is spent on the development of new
features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support.

## How to become a sponsor

In order to become an eligible sponsor with your GitHub account, visit @polakowo, 
and complete a sponsorship of __$25 a month or more__.

You can cancel your sponsorship anytime.[^2]

[^2]:
    If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request
    which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means
    that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to
    the vectorbt PRO repository as long as your cancellation isn't effective. 
    All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any 
    information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, 
    sponsorships are non-refundable.
