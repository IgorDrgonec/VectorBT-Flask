!!! info
    vectorbt PRO is a successor of the open-source version of vectorbt. Due to a vast and growing
    difference between both packages, most of the PRO features will remain exclusive and won't be merged back!

## What is vectorbt PRO?

vectorbt PRO is a private fork of vectorbt, hosted as a private GitHub repository. 
Almost all new features are developed as part of this fork, which means that they are 
immediately available to all eligible sponsors, as they are made collaborators of this repository.

Sponsorships start as low as [__$25 a month__](#how-to-become-a-sponsor).[^1]

[^1]:
    Note that $25 a month is the minimum amount to become eligible for the
    PRO version. While GitHub Sponsors also allows to sponsor lower amounts or
    one-time amounts, those can't be granted access to the PRO version due to
    technical reasons.

## What sponsorships achieve

Sponsorships make this project sustainable, as they buy the maintainers of this
project time – a very scarce resource – which is spent on the development of new
features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support.

## How to become a sponsor

In order to become an eligible sponsor with your GitHub account, visit @polakowo, 
and complete a sponsorship of __$25 a month or more__. You can use your individual or
organization GitHub account for sponsoring.

__Important__: If you're sponsoring @polakowo through a GitHub organization,
please send a short email to olegpolakow@gmail.com with the name of your
organization and the GitHub account of the individual that should be added as a 
collaborator.[^2]

[^2]:
    It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an
    organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after
    sponsoring, please send an email to olegpolakow@gmail.com, stating which
    account should become a collaborator of the PRO repository.
    To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account,
    create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific
    individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to
    the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the
    private GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the
    organizations.

You can cancel your sponsorship anytime.[^3]

[^3]:
    If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request
    which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means
    that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to
    the PRO repository as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are
    processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information
    regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are
    non-refundable.
