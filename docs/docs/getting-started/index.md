vectorbt PRO is a next-generation engine for backtesting, algorithmic trading, and research. 
It's a high-performance, actively-developed, closed-source successor to the [vectorbt](https://github.com/polakowo/vectorbt) 
library, one of the world's most innovative open-source backtesting packages. The PRO version 
extends the open-source package with new impressive features and useful enhancements.

This tool is a community-led initiative to fix information asymmetry in trading.
We bring many [SOTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art){target=_blank} tools and libraries
under one umbrella and automate them. Our vision is to make quantitative analysis and 
algorithmic trading accessible to everyone. Join us!

## What is vectorbt?

vectorbt is a Python package that combines a variety of acceleration and data science tools 
to make trading strategies and markets more transparent to quants. 

One of the unique features of vectorbt is the ability to represent any trading setup as a set of 
multidimensional arrays, where each column represents a separate configuration of a trading strategy 
and its environment. This approach allows building and backtesting entire grids of parameters at the 
speed of C, while the results can be analyzed in detail using the Python's vibrant package ecosystem - 
the best of both worlds. [Learn more](/documentation/fundamentals).

## Why vectorbt?

vectorbt follows an approach totally opposite to that of a conventional backtesting software:
instead of running a backtesting job as a single monolithic process, vectorbt divides the job
into dozens of isolated components that can be composed by the user like Lego bricks
and run independently of each other; such components include [data](/documentation/data), 
[indicators](/documentation/indicators), [signals](/tutorials/signal-development), 
[allocations](/tutorials/portfolio-optimization), [portfolio](/documentation/portfolio), and more.
Each component has its own ecosystem of analysis tools, enabling quants to analyze many facets
of a trading strategy even before it hits the actual backtesting step. This also means that
ML models can be connected at many places and integrated more easily. 

Last but not least, vectorbt was build with parameter optimization in mind: even large spaces of 
parameters can be tested in the blink of an eye, allowing quants to build dashboards and explore how 
even a tiny change in parameters impacts the overall performance, in real time!

!!! example

    Pull daily history of the BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT pairs from Binance, backtest 20k configurations 
    of the MACD indicator, and visualize the win rate as a function of the MACD parameters, 
    *in less than 30 seconds* :ice_cube:

        ```python
        import numpy as np
        import pandas as pd
        from itertools import combinations, product
        import vectorbtpro as vbt
        vbt.settings.set_theme("dark")
        
        @vbt.chunked(  # (1)!
            size=vbt.LenSizer(arg_query='fastp'),
            arg_take_spec=dict(
                data=None,
                fastp=vbt.ChunkSlicer(),
                slowp=vbt.ChunkSlicer(),
                signalp=vbt.ChunkSlicer()
            ),
            merge_func=lambda x: pd.concat(x).vbt.sort_index(),
            show_progress=True,
            chunk_len=1000  # (2)!
        )
        def pipeline(data, fastp, slowp, signalp):  # (3)!
            macd = vbt.talib("MACD").run(data.get("Close"), fastp, slowp, signalp)
            entries = macd.macd_above(0) & macd.macd_above(macd.macdsignal)  # (4)!
            exits = macd.macd_below(0) | macd.macd_below(macd.macdsignal)  # (5)!
            pf = vbt.Portfolio.from_signals(data, entries, exits, freq='d')
            return pf.trades.win_rate
        
        btc_data = vbt.BinanceData.fetch(["BTCUSDT"])  # (6)!
        eth_data = vbt.BinanceData.fetch(["ETHUSDT"])
        
        p = np.arange(4, 31)
        fastp, slowp, signalp = zip(*product(p, p, p))  # (7)!
        btc_win_rates = pipeline(btc_data, fastp, slowp, signalp)  # (8)!
        eth_win_rates = pipeline(eth_data, fastp, slowp, signalp)
        win_rates = pd.concat((btc_win_rates, eth_win_rates))  # (9)!
        win_rates.vbt.volume(  # (10)!
            slider_level="symbol",
            trace_kwargs=dict(
                colorscale="icefire", 
                colorbar=dict(title='win_rate', tickformat='.0%'),
                cmid=0.5
            ),
        ).show()
        ```
    
        1. Use chunking to reduce RAM consumption
        2. Process at most 1000 parameter combinations at a time
        3. Create a pipeline that returns the win rate for each parameter combination
        4. Enter a position whenever the MACD line is above zero and the signal line
        5. Exit the position whenever the MACD line is below zero or the signal line
        6. Fetch both datasets separately to avoid NaNs
        7. Generate 27 * 27 * 27 = 19683 parameter combinations. Since fast and slow periods
        are conditionally bound, we could (and should) have run the `itertools.combinations` instead,
        but this would only colorize a half of the cube.
        8. Win rates of each chunk get concatenated into a single series
        9. Concatenate both series. They can still be destinguished by the index level "symbol".
        10. Plot a cube by making a slider out of the index level "symbol"
        and using three other index levels (our period parameters) as the X, Y, and Z axis.

What about overfitting? vectorbt PRO supports various cross-validation schemes and robustness tests 
to bring any backtest closer to reality. We don't recommend blindly selecting the best parameter set though: 
the main utility of this tool is to gain understanding of why a certain set of parameters yields a 
certain performance - we want you to advance as a quant after all.

## What are prerequisites?

vectorbt PRO is not your average backtesting framework: instead of defining the entire logic
in a single place and only having to deal with a limited set of commands supported by the framework, vectorbt
is an open-end tool that forces you to adopt the data science approach to backtesting, that is, 
working with arrays, using third-party Python packages, building complex visualizations, and
analyzing all kinds of artifacts along the way - a sometimes steep learning curve. 

With great freedom comes great responsibility, and so at least some knowledge of Python and scientific 
computing is required. But even if you have neither, no need to worry: we'll help you through tutorials, 
documentation, and our vibrant community :handshake:

## How to get access?

vectorbt PRO is a private fork of vectorbt, hosted as a private GitHub repository. 
All new features are developed as part of this fork, which means that they are immediately 
and exclusively available to all eligible sponsors, as they are made collaborators of this repository.

!!! note
    vectorbt PRO is a closed-source successor to the open-source version of vectorbt. The entire functionality
    of this package is proprietary and will never be open-sourced.

Sponsorships start as low as [__$25 a month or $500 one time__](#how-to-become-a-sponsor).[^1]
One-time payments can also be made in :material-bitcoin: and :material-ethereum: - please [contact me](emailto:olegpolakow@gmail.com).

!!! info
    With each new milestone, the price will steadily increase to match that of competitors. By subscribing now, 
    you will become an early contributor and secure this price to access all features that will follow!

[^1]:
    This rate applies to individuals only. To grant access for an organization, please 
    [contact me](emailto:olegpolakow@gmail.com).

## What sponsorships achieve?

Sponsorships make this project sustainable, as they buy the maintainers of this
project time – a very scarce resource – which is spent on the development of new
features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support.

## How to become a sponsor?

In order to become an eligible sponsor with your GitHub account, visit @polakowo, 
and complete a sponsorship of __$25 a month or more__.

You can cancel your sponsorship anytime.[^2]

[^2]:
    If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request
    which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means
    that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to
    the vectorbt PRO repository as long as your cancellation isn't effective. 
    All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any 
    information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, 
    sponsorships are non-refundable.
