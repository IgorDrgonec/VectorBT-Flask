# Terms

The vectorbt PRO is hosted in a private repository on GitHub. The access to the repository is 
licensed and granted by invitation only on a paid basis. The users pay for the continued 
access to the repository, including updates, support, and maintenance.

If your PRO license expires, your software or system will not break down and will keep 
working fine with your most recent version by that time. However, if you discontinue your 
paid license you will lose any updates and (critical) bugfixes that will follow.

## Important note

!!! warning
    It is illegal to publish, distribute, or sell the vectorbt PRO source code without a separate 
    permission. Violation of the licensing terms will trigger a ban followed by a legal pursuit.

Any licensed user, developer, team, or company, having obtained paid access to the vectorbt 
PRO repository from us, can use vectorbt PRO as a dependency, subject to the terms and 
limitations of the vectorbt PRO paid subscription plans.

Licensees can use, copy, and modify vectorbt PRO as long as they do not vendor, publish, 
sell, or distribute the source code of vectorbt PRO.

It is allowed to specify vectorbt PRO as a dependency of your software as long as you 
do not include a copy of the vectorbt PRO source code in your software.

If you are a software developer you should specify vectorbt PRO as your requirement. 
The end-user of your software is responsible for obtaining his own individual PRO license. 
The best practice is to make it clear in your docs or on your website.

Thank you for using vectorbt PRO legally :heart:
