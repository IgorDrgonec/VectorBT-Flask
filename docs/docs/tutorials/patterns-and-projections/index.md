# :material-lock: Patterns and projections

Chart patterns are one of the foundational building blocks of technical analysis. Due to vectorbt's
exceptional performance, we can search for chart patterns in data conventionally, without the need for 
expensive machine learning models. Learn how to detect patterns of any length and complexity, and how 
to project them into the future for assistance in trading :milky_way:
